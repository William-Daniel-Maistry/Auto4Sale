                    of a mock
                    website
                    created for educational or demonstration purposes. Auto4Sale
                    does not collect, store, or process any real user data. The
                    information outlined below is fictional and only provided to
                    illustrate how a privacy policy might appear on a real
                    website.</p>
                <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
                <p>As this is a mock website, we do not collect any personal
                    information from users. We do not require you to provide any
                    real details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or
                    payment
                    information. All data used on this site is fictional and for
                    demonstration purposes only.
                </p>
                <h2>Use of Information</h2>
                <p>Any information provided by users, such as email addresses or
                    account details, is purely fictional and will not be used
                    for
                    any real business transactions, communications, or
                    marketing.</p>

                <p>This website does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or
                    third-party services that collect personal data. Since this
                    site
                    is a mock project, no information is tracked or stored.
                </p>

                    control
                    these links or their privacy practices. Any interactions

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>Auto4Sale does not store or process any real data, so there
