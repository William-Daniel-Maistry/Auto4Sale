                    mock project created for educational or demonstration
                    purposes
                    only. It is not a real website, and no actual transactions,
                    data
                    collection, or services are being provided. By accessing or
                    viewing this website, you acknowledge that this is a

                <h2>General Terms</h2>
                <p>- These Terms govern your use of the Auto4Sale website, which
                    is
                    a mock project created for educational purposes. Please note
                    that this website is not real, and any transactions, data
                    collection, or user interactions are purely fictional.</p>
                <p>- We reserve the right to modify, update, or change these
                    Terms
                    at any time for the purposes of demonstration. Your
                    continued
                    use of the website signifies your acceptance of these
                    changes,
                    though this site is not meant for actual use.</p>
                <h2>Vehicle Listings and Sales</h2>
                <p>- All vehicles listed on Auto4Sale are purely fictional and
                    are
                    not available for actual purchase. This website serves as a
                    demonstration of how vehicle listings could be presented on
                    a
                    car dealership site.</p>
                <p>- No real transactions are conducted, and no real vehicles
                    are
                    for sale through this website.</p>
                <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>- Any references to payment methods, transactions, or pricing
                    on
                    this website are purely for demonstration purposes. This
                    site
                    does not process any real payments, and all financial
                    details
                    are fictional.</p>
                <h2>User Conduct</h2>
                <p>- You agree to use Auto4Sale only for its intended
                    demonstration

                    rights of
                    others.</p>
                <p>- As this is a mock site, no actual content is being posted
                    or
                    shared with real users, so we ask that users respect the
                    fictional nature of the platform.</p>
